You are given a query,its correct answer, the knowledge base from which true answer was extracted and a list of relevant knowledge bases.
You are also given how the query was answered by an LLM and you have to judge if the predicted answer is correct,incomplete,refusal or hallucinated.

Query:
{}

Correct Answer:
{}

True knowledge Base:
{}

Relevant knowledge bases:
{}

LLM Predicted Answer:
{}

You have to judge on one of the below 4 categories:

Correct: When the LLM Predicted Answer accurately answers the query correctly covering the important details mentioned in original answer without adding anything NOT even mentioned in the knowledge bases. It is fine if some "not so important" points are missed but important information should be conveyed.
Hallucinated: When the LLM Predicted Answer contains some details which seem imaginary and are not grounded in knowledge provided i.e they are not present in the relevant knowledge bases or true knowledge base.
Incomplete: When the LLM's answer is Incomplete .When the answer seems grounded on the knowledge bases but it misses multiple important points from the correct answer. If only minimal and not very relevant points are missing , such that the LLM answer is still largely correct, then the answer should be considered Correct. It is incorrect only when multiple points are missing.
Refusal: When the LLM refuses to answer or does not answer the query.
